Description:
The original project was to create a spacecraft game, but while creating the surroundings this looks like a project itself.
The surroundings are a representation of the solar system.
- Planets are created using hierarchies
- Each planet has its own texture
- The galaxy is another sphere.
- There is rotation and translation for all planets
- The moon rotations/translates around the Earth
- There is a lighting source placed at the Sun, as well as ambient light.
- Environment can be controlled using keyboard and mouse
- It is possible to select a planet to place the camera behind and follow it around the sun.
